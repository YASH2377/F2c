## Overview

TerraDirect is a mobile-first web application that connects consumers directly with regenerative and natural farmers. It enables transparent discovery of farming practices, verification of organic certifications, and a streamlined checkout flow — all while ensuring farmers receive fair, direct compensation.

### Why TerraDirect?

The conventional food supply chain is opaque. Consumers can't verify farming practices, and farmers lose margins to middlemen. TerraDirect solves both problems:

- **For Consumers** — Browse verified farms, see real certifications, and understand exactly where your food comes from.
- **For Farmers** — Sell directly to your community with a transparency score that builds trust organically.

---

## Features

### 🌱 Discovery Dashboard
- Hero section with brand messaging
- Real-time search across farms, products, locations, and practices
- Filter chips (All / Verified / Nearby / Organic)
- Responsive bento grid of farmer cards with lazy-loaded images
- Platform stats bar (verified farms count, direct percentage, avg delivery)

### 👨‍🌾 Farmer Profiles & Management
- Full-width hero with gradient overlay and farmer avatar
- **Profile Editing**: Dedicated management interface for farmers to update farm name, bio, location, and payout methods
- **Cover Photo Management**: Integrated Cloudinary upload for high-fidelity farm branding
- Verified badge (stamp metaphor) or pending status indicator
- Transparency indicator — animated bar showing direct-to-farmer percentage
- Farming practices grid with Material icons
- Product catalog with add-to-cart functionality
- Verification gallery with certification details, issue dates, and cert IDs
- **"Message Farmer" button** for direct 1-on-1 chat (logged-in customers only)

### 🛒 Checkout Flow

- Delivery form with address, date picker, and notes
- Mock payment form (demo — writes order to Firestore only)
- Sticky order summary with quantity controls
- Free delivery threshold ($35+)
- Order confirmation screen

### 🔐 Authentication & Roles
- Email/password sign up with **Role Selection** (Farmer vs. Customer)
- Google SSO with post-login role assignment for first-time users
- **Differentiated Onboarding**:
  - **Farmers**: Professional profile setup (Farm name, story, payout methods)
  - **Customers**: Delivery preferences (Address, phone, location)
- **Role-Based Routing**: Automatic redirection post-login (Farmers to Dashboard, Customers to Discovery)
- **Strict Access Control**: Role-gated routes and Firestore security rules to prevent unauthorized access
- Mock auth mode for rapid development (bypass Firebase setup)

### 💬 Direct Messaging & Presence
- Real-time 1-on-1 chat between customers and farmers
- **Presence Tracking**: Real-time online/offline status using Firebase Realtime Database and `onDisconnect()` hooks
- **Live Typing Indicators**: Visual feedback when the recipient is actively composing a message
- Conversation list with last message preview and relative timestamps
- Auto-scrolling message thread with time-stamped bubbles
- Deterministic chat IDs (`uid1_uid2`) for deduplication
- Firestore real-time `onSnapshot` listener for instant updates
- Participant-only access enforced by security rules

### 📦 Product Addition (Farmer)
- Dedicated product creation page with **multi-image upload** (1–5 images)
- Firebase Storage upload with per-file and total progress tracking
- Image preview grid with cover indicator and remove buttons
- **Shelf life** selector (number + hours/days/weeks unit)
- Pricing unit dropdown (kg, gram, piece, dozen, liter, bunch)
- File validation: type (JPG/PNG/WebP/GIF) and size (max 5MB each)
- Success screen with "Add Another" or "Go to Dashboard" options

### 🌓 Dark Mode
- System preference detection on first visit
- Manual toggle with animated icon (persisted to localStorage)
- Dual design token sets from Stitch design system
- Smooth 300ms transition on all themed surfaces

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Framework** | React 18.3 | Component UI with hooks |
| **Build** | Vite 6 | Fast HMR, ESM-native bundling |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS 3.4 | Utility-first with CSS custom properties |
| **Backend** | Firebase | Auth, Firestore, Realtime DB, Storage |
| **Routing** | React Router DOM 6 | Client-side SPA routing |
| **Fonts** | Google Fonts | Newsreader (serif), Work Sans (sans) |
| **Icons** | Material Symbols Outlined | Consistent iconography |

---

## Dual-Environment Architecture

TerraDirect runs two isolated environments from a **single codebase**:

| | Demo | Production |
|---|---|---|
| **URL** | `terradirectf2c-demo.web.app` | `terradirectf2c.web.app` |
| **Authentication** | Pre-logged mock user (Alex Demo) | Real Firebase Auth |
| **Data Source** | In-memory `mockData.js` | Firestore real-time |
| **Image Upload** | Simulated (placeholder URLs) | Cloudinary |
| **Persistence** | None (resets on reload) | Permanent |
| **Use Case** | Demos, testing, future features | Live users, real transactions |

### How It Works

- `VITE_ENVIRONMENT` is set at build-time via Vite's `--mode` flag
- `EnvironmentContext` provides `'demo'` or `'production'` to the tree
- `AuthContext` branches: demo returns a pre-logged user, production uses Firebase Auth
- `ServiceContext` lazy-imports `mock.service.js` or `firebase.service.js`
- Demo builds include a fixed green banner: *"Demo Mode — All data is simulated"*

---

## Design System

TerraDirect uses a custom **Modern-Organic** design system derived from Stitch with two distinct visual personas:

### Light Mode — "Grounded Transparency"
- **Palette:** Warm bone (#faf9f7) surfaces, Deep Forest Green (#061b0e) primary
- **Feel:** Minimalist, tactile, matte-paper aesthetic with glassmorphism effects
- **Shadows:** Subtle ambient shadows with warm undertones

### Dark Mode — "Editorial Artisanal"
- **Palette:** Stone-tinted blacks (#121412) with soft sage (#bccbb9) primary
- **Feel:** Editorial, dramatic, moody night-market atmosphere with premium glass overlays
- **Shadows:** Deeper ambient shadows for depth

### Typography Scale

| Token | Font | Size | Weight | Use |
|-------|------|------|--------|-----|
| `display-xl` | Newsreader | 48px | 600 | Page titles |
| `headline-lg` | Newsreader | 32px | 500 | Section headers |
| `headline-md` | Newsreader | 24px | 500 | Card titles |
| `body-lg` | Work Sans | 18px | 400 | Lead paragraphs |
| `body-md` | Work Sans | 16px | 400 | Body text |
| `label-sm` | Work Sans | 14px | 600 | Labels, badges |
| `button` | Work Sans | 16px | 600 | Button text |

### Color Architecture

All 50+ color tokens are defined as CSS custom properties in `src/index.css`, enabling seamless dark mode switching without Tailwind's `dark:` prefix on every utility. The `tailwind.config.js` references these variables so `bg-primary`, `text-on-surface`, etc. automatically adapt to the active theme.

---

## Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **CSS Custom Properties for theming** | Single class name (e.g., `bg-primary`) works in both light and dark mode without duplicating `dark:` variants |
| **Mock data layer** | Enables instant development without Firebase setup; controlled by a single env var |
| **useReducer for cart** | Predictable state transitions for add/remove/update; persists to localStorage for offline resilience |
| **IntersectionObserver for images** | Native lazy loading with 200px root margin for smooth scroll; includes skeleton placeholder and error fallback |
| **Protected routes with redirect** | Checkout and Dashboard require auth; users are redirected based on role and onboarding status |
| **Role-based security rules** | Firestore rules enforce that only 'farmer' roles can create/edit products or farm data |
| **Differentiated onboarding** | Tailored data collection paths for Farmers vs. Customers to keep user profiles lean and relevant |
| **Deterministic chat IDs** | `uid1_uid2` (sorted) ensures each user pair has exactly one chat — no duplicates |
| **Cloudinary for images** | Products uploaded via unsigned preset; URLs stored in Firestore |
| **Farmer gatekeeper (getUserData)** | Security rules read the user's `/users` doc at database level to verify `role == 'farmer'` before allowing product creation |
| **Realtime DB for presence/typing** | Offloads high-frequency, transient state from Firestore to save costs and reduce latency |
| **Dual-environment architecture** | Single codebase, two entry points — `EnvironmentContext` + `ServiceContext` route to mock or real services at build time |
